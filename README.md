# License Selection (Week 3 – iPython / Google Colab)

For this Week 3 repository, I selected the **MIT License**.

The Week 3 assignment mainly contains iPython / Google Colab notebooks used for 
basic Python experiments and simple exploratory coding.  
The MIT License is suitable because it allows others to freely reuse, modify, or 
learn from the notebook without heavy restrictions, while still requiring that 
the original copyright notice be preserved.  
Since this repository is primarily educational and does not include 
sensitive or proprietary code, a permissive and widely adopted license like MIT 
is the most appropriate choice.
